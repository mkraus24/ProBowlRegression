# Pro Bowl Regression

## Introduction

It's that time of year again. The Pro Bowl (Games) rosters have been announced and the NFL world was once again quick to judge who should and should not have been selected. Like many others, I saw a few players on the roster that, in my opinion, did not deserve to make the trip to Vegas. However, as I delve deeper into my sport analytics journey, I wanted to determine whether or not each player should have made the final roster according to the statistics each player recorded.

## Notes

1. Data includes Pro Bowl selections from 2012 to 2022.
2. Positions such as offensive linemen and special teams players are not included.
3. Only the original Pro Bowl selections are used. Replacements are labeled as not selected.
4. All data is from Pro Football Reference.
